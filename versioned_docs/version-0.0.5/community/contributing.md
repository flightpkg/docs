## Pull Request Process

<br />

Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it. It is recommended to follow this commit message style.

Please make sure the following is done when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from master.
2. Describe your test plan in your pull request description. Make sure to test your changes!
3. Make sure your code lints (yarn format).

All pull requests should be opened against the master branch.
